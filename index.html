	<h3>About Me</h3>
	
	<p>I'm Julian, a first year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell. I did my undergrad in CS at Berkeley.<br> 
	Broadly speaking, I'm inerested in HPC. More specifically, I'm interested in developing 
	programming systems (whatever the hell that means) that make it easier
	to write fast, parallel code meant to run in heterogeneous 
	environments.</p>

	<h3> Research Goal </h3>

	<p>
	Basically, the future of HPC (and probably all domains of 
	computer science) will see increasing amounts of parallelism and 
	heterogeneity. 
	
	<br>	

	Writing fast parallel code is painful and difficult, and writing fast 
	parallel code when you're dealing with different kinds of hardware is 
	even more painful. However, since parallelism and heterogeneity will 
	become more pervasive as time goes on, it will become more and more 
	necessary for more and more people (including domain scientists who
	just want to write Python and Matlab all day) to be able to write 
	fast parallel/hardware-aware code. 

	<br>	

	Using our current set of programming technologies, writing such code
	is not sufficiently intuitive. My goal is to remedy this. How will I do this?
	I have no idea. Give me 6 years and I might have something.

	<h3> Current Projects </h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Hooninator/symPACK">symPACK</a>, a solver for sparse symmetric PSD matrices. I am working to add GPU support to symPACK. 
		<a href="https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/applied-mathematics-dept/scalable-solvers/research-areas/sympack/">Here is more info about symPACK</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/exo-lang/exo">Exo</a>, a DSL for writing performant schedules for diverse algorithms on diverse hardware. I am collaborating with members of Jonathan Ragan-Kelley's research group to write a complete BLAS implementation using Exo.</li>

	<p>What does it mean for something to be "true"? Is something real if it only happens in your own mind?</p>
