	<h3>About Me</h3>
	
	<p>I'm Julian, a first year PhD student at Cornell. Broadly speaking, 
	I'm inerested in HPC. More specifically, I'm interested in developing 
	programming systems (whatever the hell that means) that make it easier
	to write fast, parallel code meant to run in heterogeneous 
	environments.</p>
	
	<h3> Research Goal </h3>

	<p>
	Basically, the future of HPC (and probably all domains of 
	computer science) will see increasing amounts of parallelism and 
	heterogeneity. 
	
	Writing fast parallel code is painful and difficult, and writing fast 
	parallel code when you're dealing with different kinds of hardware is 
	even more painful. However, since parallelism and heterogeneity will 
	become more pervasive as time goes on, it will become more and more 
	necessary for more and more people (including domain scientists who
	just want to write Python and Matlab all day) to be able to write 
	fast parallel/hardware-aware code. 
	
	Using our current set of programming technologies, writing such code
	is not sufficiently intuitive. My goal is to remedy this. How will I do this?
	I have no idea. Give me 6 years and I might have something.
